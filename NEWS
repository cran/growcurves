Version 0.1.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES

* first release on CRAN.

* performs Bayesian semi-parametric mixed effects modeling on repeated measures data.

* allows a DP prior on a set of subject random effects to borrow strength across subjects for estimation.

* simultaneously supports definition of random effects under other than subject groupings with one or more multiple membership (MM) terms.

* package functions are constructed to promote intuitive structures for data input and ease-of-use for model outputs.

* the dpgrow function performs mixed effects modeling without an MM term (but with a DP prior on the set of subject random effects).

* the dpgrowmm function extends dpgrow by allowing for a single MM term under one of three prior formulation options = c("mmi","mmigrp","mmcar").

* the dpgrowmult function extends dpgrowmm by allowing for any number of MM terms, each under one of four prior formulation options = c("mmi","mmigrp","mmcar","mmdp").

* there are also 3 accompanying graphical accessor functions for the 3 sampling functions to promote easy analysis:

* the growplot function produces and plots by-subject growth curves under any user defined grouping.

* the trtplot function compares the distribution for the difference in fixed effects means between any two treatment arms.

* the effectsplot function compares the mean effect values for an MM term under different prior and model formulations.
